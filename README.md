# Picross Solver

## TODO

- Automatically generate and save board to JSON if one doesn't exist
- Define solvers base cases
- Test that importing variable sized Picrosses displays correctly
    - 5x5
    - 10x15
    - 20x20


## Notes to Self

Handling the Dictionary flattening is easy if I want to just check for the existence of a value

When I need to find what Key that value is living at, then it becomes harder
